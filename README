IDEAS/TODO:
    1. Write this into a Ajax based front end engine <-- fucking rights on that idea
        This means that there is a full working ajax engine build on a low level to support l33t and fast requests
    
    2. If I want to i might complete the PHP support, not sure if i even want full PHP support.
    
    3. Add modules such as authentication
